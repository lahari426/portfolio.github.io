    <h3><B>IOT BASED VEHICLE PARKING MANAGER</B></h3>
    <p>In this Vehicle Parking Manager project it aims to produce the information whether the
         particular parking slot is available or not with the help of LDR and IR sensors.
        With the help of these LDR and IR sensors we can detect the parking slot is available
         or not.That means if the parking area is empty it will give us the message as Slot:E 
         so we can park our car else Slot:F we can't park our car which is displayed on LCD. </p>
